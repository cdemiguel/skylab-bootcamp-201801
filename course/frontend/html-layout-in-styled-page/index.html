	<h1>A Really Great Dog</h1>
	<aside><img src="" alt=""></aside>
	<section>
			<h2>Dogs seem to come in all sizes</h2>
			<p><a href="">shapes and color</a> - every kind of personality that a person could imagine. Everyone seems to have their favorite breed. I guess that is good since it gives many dogs opportunities to have great homes and develop special skills. Many breeds perform very important jobs for people. I personally love the mixed breeds since I have seen literally thousands during my years of helping the shelter. They are all still great dogs inside - some are just a little prettier than others! But every dog, no matter their breeding, is a loyal companion giving unconditional love.
